# Making predictions

.center.width-80[![](images/dt_structure_depth2.svg)]

Put new sample through our tree. When we arrive at a leaf predict that this
sample belongs to the majority class.

$P(R | X) = \frac{R}{B+R}$ and $P(B | X) = \frac{B}{B+R}$

Trees are very fast to execute at prediction/inference time.

---

# How to grow a tree?

The goal is to create leaves that are pure so we can use majority class as
prediction for new samples.

* finding the optimal partioning of the input space is (in general) not feasible
* grow tree in a greedy (one step at a time) fashion!

Algorithm:
1. Pick a node, check if node is pure
    * if yes mark it as a leaf
    * else:
        1. find split point $S$ for feature $j$ that leads to largest decrease of impurity
        1. split node into two child nodes according to this split
2. go to 1.

# Two questions, which one is better?

How full is the train? vs What is the weather like?

# Node splitting

For each node find the split point $S$ on feature $j$ that leads to largest
decreases of the impurity.

$$\Delta = I\_T - \frac{n\_L}{N} I\_L - \frac{n\_R}{N} I\_R$$

* $I_T$: impurity of current node
* $I_L$: impurity of left child node
* $I_R$: impurity of right child node

$I_L$ and $I_R$ depend on the feature $j$ and split point $S$ chosen to split
samples in the current node.

---

# Measure impurity of a node

Two common measures for classification tasks:

* cross-entropy: $- \sum\_{k} p\_{mk} \log(p\_{mk})$
* Gini index: $\sum\_k p\_{mk}(1-p\_{mk})$

# Tree stops growing when nodes are pure

.center.width-80[![](images/dt_structure_depth10.svg)]

---

# Tree structure

Growing a fully developed tree generally does not lead to good generalisation.

Either limit tree growth or prune tree after it has been grown.

Implemented in scikit-learn:
* `max_depth`
* `max_leaf_nodes`
* `min_samples_split`
* `min_impurity_decrease`

---

# No limit on tree growth

---

# Regression trees

Prediction:

$$ \bar{y}\_m = \frac{1}{N\_m} \sum_{i \in N\_m} y\_i $$

Impurity measures:
  * mean squared error: $$\frac{1}{N\_m} \sum\_{i \in N\_m} (y\_i - \bar{y}\_m)^2 $$
  * mean absolute error: $$\frac{1}{N\_m} \sum\_{i \in N\_m} |y\_i - \bar{y}\_m|$$

# The key: uncorrelated models

How could we build models that are uncorrelated with each other?

* only show a subset of the data to each model
* only consider a subset of the features at each split

# Gradient boosting

(Chapter 4)

---

# Step by step example

$$f_1(x) \approx y$$

$$f_2(x) \approx y - f_1(x)$$

$$f_3(x) \approx y - f_1(x) - f_2(x)$$

At each step you try and fix the mistakes made by the previous model. The
model is fitted to the residuals of the previous step.

# Step by step example

$$f_1(x) \approx y$$

$$f_2(x) \approx y - \alpha f_1(x)$$

$$f_3(x) \approx y - \alpha f_1(x) - \alpha f_2(x)$$

$$f_4(x) \approx y - \alpha f_1(x) - \alpha f_2(x) - \alpha f_3(x)$$

At each step you try and fix the mistakes made by the previous model. The
model is fitted to the residuals of the previous step.

In practice you want to make small adjustments as you go along, each
model is multiplied by $\alpha$. This is also referred to as "shrinkage"
or "learning rate".

* Categorical features? No problem!
* different scales per feature? No problem!
